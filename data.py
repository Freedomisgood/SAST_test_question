str_demo = b"""The early versions of Windows are often 
thought of as graphical shells, mostly because they ran on top of 
MS-DOS and use it for file system services.[12] However, even the 
earliest Windows versions already assumed many 
typical operating system functions; notably, 
having their own executable file format and 
providing their own device drivers 
(timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard and sound). 
Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute 
multiple graphical applications at the same time, 
through cooperative multitasking. Windows implemented an 
elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, 
which allows it to run applications larger than available memory: code
 segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became 
 scarce; data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished
  processor control."""
